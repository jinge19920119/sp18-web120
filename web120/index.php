<p>Hello, how is your day going? Welcome to Jin's page. Here shows what I've done in Web120. My name is Jin and I come from China. I love sports, especially basketball. You guys must have guessed out who is my favorite. Correct! He is Russel Westbrook, a superman that nothing is impossible for him. His powerful basketball is so amazing and attractive!</p>
<p>I want to be a full stack software engineer that can develop the software from back end to front end. And I hope I can learn a lot in this class.</p>
